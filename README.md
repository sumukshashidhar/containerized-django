# What is this? 

Environment based issues are extremely hard to deal with. The last thing any one of us wants, is to figure out that something doesn't run when deployed due to a dependency issue. This is where Docker comes to the save. 

# What does this do

This creates a Production Grade Docker Container using `gunicorn`, `django`, and `docker`. 

# What does this help you with. 

This is simple demo / example to help you with professionally containerizing your docker application. Your django app remains unchanged, this is just an external wrapper.
